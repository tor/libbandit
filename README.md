# LibBandit

LibBandit is a C++ library designed for efficiently simulating [multi-armed bandit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) algorithms, by [Tor Lattimore](https://github.com/tor).

Currently the following algorithms are implemented:

* UCB
* Optimally confident UCB (OCUCB)
* Almost optimally confident UCB
* Thompson sampling (Gaussian prior)
* MOSS
* Finite-horizon Gittins index (Gaussian/Gaussian model/prior)
* An approximation of the finite-horizon Gittins index
* Bayesian optimal for two arms (Gaussian/Gaussian model/prior)

Defining new noise models is as simple as extending a base class and implementing the reward function.


## Compiling

You will need a C++11 compliant compiler such as `g++` 4.8 or `clang` 5.

LibBandit uses the [Scons build system](http://scons.org/). With this installed, you should be able to compile all sources by typing `scons`


## Using the Library

LibBandit is easy to use. See the [examples/ folder](examples/).


## Gittins Index

The library includes code for efficiently generating Gittins indices for a Gaussian prior and noise model. 
Included is a precomputed table of indices for horizons up to `5,000`. See the [examples/ folder](examples/) for details on how to use this data. 

To compute the indices yourself use `makegittins build <file> <horizon> <tolerance> <maxthreads>`.

The tolerance should be chosen as small as possible. The pre-computed table used `tolerance = 0.000005`.

You can lookup the Gittins index in a table with `makegittins lookup <file> <horizon> <T>` where `<horizon>` is the number of rounds remaining and `<T>` is the number of samples from that arm.

A *larger* pre-computed table for horizon `10,000` and tolerance `0.000005` is available for download from http://downloads.tor-lattimore.com/gittins/10000.zip.

## Contributing

If you implement a new algorithm, please

1. test it against existing algorithms and
2. contact me to become a contributor so others can easily test against your algorithm.
